<h1>Tinkering</h1>
<p>I'm constantly trying to improve the environment.<br>
Whatever I do, if I know I'm going to be doing it for a long time, I try to make the processes more comfortable. Even before cooking I need to clean the kitchen, before sporoting I need to put on comfortable clothes and take drinking water.</p>
<p>When it comes to working with computers, I know that I will be doing it for more than just the next day. I want to spend my whole life with computers.</p>
<p>So trying to find even a 5% improvement in workflow doesn't seem so useless to me.<br>
And to be honest, I find it very interesting and fun!<br>
I change <a href="https://eylenburg.github.io/os_comparison.htm">distributions</a>, terminals, environments, and on and on.</p>
<h2>Tools that I use and have used for some time now</h2>

<td><a href="https://swaywm.org/">Sway</a></td>

<tr>
<td>Notes</td>
<td><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><a href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq</a></td>
<td>Used previously.  Opensource. Really well-designed. My note-taking habits developed from using it - bullets, journals, all note in one place. Personally dislike the Org-mode date format and lack of simple checkboxes. No extensions on mobile.  Definitely not so polished and community-supported as Obsidian. <br>Probably will return to it when they will relise database version.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Editor</td>
<td><a href="https://helix-editor.com/">Helix</a></td>
<td>Great terminal text editor with all needed features, themes backed in. Static config in toml and that's enough. Feels great, current editor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a></td>
<td>Previously used. Customizible af. Config in some script language. Good for pro, but coding is not my job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Passwords</td>
<td><a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeepassXC</a><br><a href="https://www.keepassdx.com/">KeepassDX</a></td>
<td>Local, easy, simple, with ssh-agent and browser integration, and android app. Best of the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Syncing Notes, Passwords</td>
<td><a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a></td>
<td>Sync between devices without leaving local network. I just disabled public discovery. Works really well.</td>
