			Well, it feels like I'm not hugry anymore. And that turns out to be a problem.
		</h2>

		<p>
			When I was a teenager, adults told me what my parents should
			do. I resisted, I wrinkled
			my face, I got distracted by all sorts of little things, but I did it. <br />
			I had classes and exams, I had a chance to go to a good university, I had
			something to
			do, and knew what would happen.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I first moved away from my parents, I was trying to figure out how to live.
			How to
			get my first job, what foods I could cook quickly and easily, how I could rent
			my own
			place and move out on my own.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, I think I got used to it, and realized that I clearly didn't have enough
			money to
			live the full life I wanted to live. <br />
			That became my goal for a few years - to become a professional in a job that I
			enjoy so
			that I could afford to live comfortably. <br />
		</p>
		<p>
			And now I seem to be working at a job that I'm not ashamed of.
			I get a good enough salary by the standards of a poor family I grew up in, I
			moved to
			the capital, I can afford a good
			apartment, food, health care.
		</p>
		<p>
			I will definitely continue to raise my salary, just as I will continue to learn
			cooking.
			<br />
			But now it seems that lack of money no longer prevents me from doing other
			things.<br />
			I can make time for something truly worthwhile, but I don'teven know what.
			<br />
			Poverty and lack of skills used to bite at my heels, I used to run from them and
			due to that I realized my path.
		</p>
		<h5>
			Now I seem to have solved my problems, and that's a problem.
		</h5>
		<p>
			I finished the corridor tutorial, went out into the open world and... there
			are no quests. <br />
			Somehow I need to now decide what kind of person I am in general, and what
			personally worthwhile things I can do.
