			<h1> What is web about?</h1>
			<p> It's hard to describe the WWW by its content. <br />
				We know the web in various guises:
			<ul style="columns: 9em 4;">
				<li>social networks</li>
				<li>search engines</li>
				<li>streaming platforms</li>
				<li>stores</li>
				<li>messengers</li>
				<li>online games</li>
				<li>banks </li>
				<li>pirate platforms</li>
				<li>cloud services</li>
				<li>news</li>
				<li>18+</li>
				<li>blogs</li>
			</ul>
			Whichever option you choose, for the web it will be only a partial description, not really describing it in its
			entirety.
			</p>
			<p class="c">
				Some might say that the web is about protocols. But how many people use the web THINKING about protocols? It's
				more about how the web is organized under the hood. <br />
				Similarly, a car is a four-wheeled, self-driving vehicle. You can make a car with an combustion engine
				and an electric motor, but it will still be a car.
			</p>

			<h2> The web is about people and connecting with them.</h2>
			<p>
				We write to people in messengers, explore other people's thoughts on blogs and streaming services, indirectly
				interact with people's products in services like banks and cloud services.<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				To build a website, you need to think about what the design will be, you need to think about how and what you'll
				write about, you need to care about the project. Even though HTML/CSS is not that complicated after all, it
				requires some thinking.<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				With so much choice and additional training required, social networks create a much easier alternative —
				ready-made design, obvious posting options, promotion mechanisms and most importantly — all your friends are
				already on the platform! <br />
			</p>
			<p>
				But in the context of social networks, people eventually start to limit their creativity to the platform, and
				start to evaluate everything in likes, comments or other reactions to the post.<br>
			<ul>
				<li> How can you even recognize a person from a single tweet? The entire tweet is literally a phrase taken out
					of context, a literal rage-fuel created to trigger a reaction and desire to respond.
					Who would have thought there would be shitstorms on Twitter all the time?</li>

				<li> How likely would you be to read this post if it had 0 likes, if there was a post with 1000 likes next to
					it?
					Does the number of likes make something unworthy of reading?
					The social network probably wouldn't even show it to you. </li>

				<li>Even the simplest of things - why do we have a higher level of trust in people who have more followers?</li>
			</ul>

			All of this turns social media into games of gaining social attention/approval. It shifts the focus of attention
			of both the people who create content and the people who consume it, to the game around social media, rather
			than the people themselves and their thoughts. <br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Is that creepy? Convenient? Unnatural? Familiar? <br>
				I don't know. But there's definitely a lot of money in it.
			</p>
			<h5>And I just don't want to be part of that system.</h5>

			<h3>I love the small web and its possibilities:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> take long walks through links</li>
				<li> saving endless pages to look at later</li>
				<li> to read people's explicit positions</li>
				<li> to explore personalities and their aesthetics</li>
				<li> strange designs</li>
				<li> big websites about small topics</li>
			</ul>
			And that's what I'd like to share. So welcome and enjoy your browsing.
