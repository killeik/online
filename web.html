			<h1> What is web about?</h1>
			<p> It's hard to describe the WWW by its content. <br />
				We know the web in various guises:
			<ul style="columns: 9em 4;">
				<li>social networks</li>
				<li>search engines</li>
				<li>streaming platforms</li>
				<li>stores</li>
				<li>messengers</li>
				<li>online games</li>
				<li>banks </li>
				<li>pirate platforms</li>
				<li>cloud services</li>
				<li>news</li>
				<li>18+</li>
				<li>blogs</li>
			</ul>
			Whichever option you choose, for the web it will be only a partial description, not really describing it in its
			entirety.
			</p>
			<p class="container">
				Some might say that the web is about protocols. But how many people use the web THINKING about protocols? It's
				more about how the web is organized under the hood. <br />
				Similarly, a car is a four-wheeled, self-driving vehicle. You can make a car with an combustion engine
				and an electric motor, but it will still be a car.
			</p>

			<h2> The web is about people and connecting with them.</h2>
			<p>
				We write to people in messengers, explore other people's thoughts on blogs and streaming services, indirectly
				interact with people's products in services like banks and cloud services.<br />
			</p>

			<h3>I love the small web and its possibilities:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> take long walks through links</li>
				<li> saving endless pages to look at later</li>
				<li> to read people's explicit positions</li>
				<li> to explore personalities and their aesthetics</li>
				<li> strange designs</li>
				<li> big websites about small topics</li>
			</ul>
			And that's what I'd like to share. So welcome and enjoy your browsing.
			<h4>Here are the top of my favorite sites.</h4>
