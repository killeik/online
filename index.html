		<h1> Hello, friend!</h1>
		<p> There is nothing going on right now, but I'll fix it soon </p>
		<p> And after adding some content, I will try to make a better design to suit it. </p>

		<h3> Why website? </h3>
		<p> Well, I'm kinda in some form of <a class="foreground" href="blog.html">identity crisis</a>.
			It's not so scary - I'm just not sure what I want to do with my life.
		</p>

		<blockquote cite="blog.html" class="card">
			To understand who I am and what I like, I'm creating this website. <br />
			I will try to share my hobbies, interests and all that I like in some form on this website, to be aware of
			that.
			<br />
			And to support the weird, but beautiful Small Web.
		</blockquote>

		<h3> How I'm doing it: </h3>
		<p> Pure, straight-forward HTML, basic CSS, and no JS. </p>
		<p> Editing code in <a href="https://helix-editor.com"> helix</a>, saving code on GitHub, and self-hosting the
			website via Nginx in Docker, on VPS. </p>
