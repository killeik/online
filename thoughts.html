			<h1> Identity crysis (?)</h1>
			<p>
				Well, it feels like I'm not hungry anymore. And that turns out to be a problem.
			</p>
		</header>
		<p>
			When I was a teenager, adults told me what I should do.
			I resisted, wrinkled my face, and got distracted by all sorts of little things, but I did what they told me to do.
			<br />
			I had classes and exams, had a chance to go to a good university, had something to do, and knew what would happen.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I moved away from my parents, I was trying to figure out how to live.
			How to get my first job, what I should cook, and how to rent apartments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, when I got used to living by myself, I realized that I clearly didn't have enough money to live the full
			life I wanted to live.
			That became my goal for a few years - to become a professional in a job to afford a comfortable life.
		</p>
		<p>
			And now I seem to be working at a good enough job and getting paid a good enough salary by the standards of the
			poor family I grew up in.
			I moved to the capital and can afford a good enough apartment, food, and health care.
		</p>
		<p>
			I will definitely continue to raise my salary, just like I didn't stop to think about better apartments, food,
			etc.
			But now it seems that lack of money no longer prevents me from doing other things.
			I can make time for something truly worthwhile, but I don't even know what.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Now I seem to have solved my problems, and that's a problem
		</h4>
		<p>
			Somehow, I need to now decide what kind of person I am in general and what personally worthwhile things I can do.
			To understand who I am and what I like, I'm creating this website. <br />
			I will try to share all my hobbies, interests and all that I like in some form on this website, to be aware of
			that. <br />
			And to support the weird, but beautiful Small Web.
