<p style="color:black; margin:auto;"> 
My website respects 
<a style="color:black; text-decoration-color: black;" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-adjust-1/#preferred-color-scheme">
preferred-color-scheme</a>, but it looks cooler in a dark theme!

# Hello, friend!

Website is under development, so it's fine if you meet some 404 skeletons :p

## What this place is about

-  This website is documentation of what I actually like.
-  I'm trying to write down clear rules for what I like and dislike and explain why I think so.
-  Also, I plan to gradually expand the lists in each category. For example, adding links to beautiful websites, useful tools, etc.
-  This page is the documentation for the entire website.

## The principles of content

-  This website is my subjective position and does not claim to be the objective truth.  
   I will try to express my position honestly and without a huge disclaimer before each article.
-  My position changes. The content of the site reflects my position at the time of writing.  
   The expression of my position on the site is probably outdated by now.
-  [Hypertextual maximalism](https://libre.town/thoughts/entry_9.xhtml)
-  ASCII art is beautiful!

## How I'm doing it:

Pure, straight-forward HTML, basic CSS, and no JS.

-  Editing in [helix](https://helix-editor.com)
-  Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/killeik/online)
-  Rendering to HTML from templates/markdown with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)
-  Web-server - [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) with Docker Compose
-  Configuration in Ansible
-  Self-hosting on VPS.
