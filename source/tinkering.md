# Tinkering

I'm constantly trying to improve the environment. 
Whatever I do, if I know I'm going to be doing it for a long time, I try to make the processes more comfortable. Even before cooking I need to clean the kitchen, before sporoting I need to put on comfortable clothes and take drinking water. 

When it comes to working with computers, I know that I will be doing it for more than just the next day. I want to spend my whole life with computers. 

So trying to find even a 5% improvement in workflow doesn't seem so useless to me. 
And to be honest, I find it very interesting and fun!
I change [distributions](https://eylenburg.github.io/os_comparison.htm), terminals, environments, and on and on. 

## Tools that I use and have used for some time now

My note-taking habits developed from using it - bullets, journals, all note in one place. Personally dislike the Org-mode date format and lack of simple checkboxes. No extensions on mobile.
