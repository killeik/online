# What is web about?

It's hard to describe the WWW by its content.  
We know the web in various guises:

<div style="columns: 9em 4;">

-   social networks
-   search engines
-   streaming platforms
-   stores
-   messengers
-   online games
-   banks
-   pirate platforms
-   cloud services
-   news
-   18+
-   blogs

</div>

Whichever option you choose, for the web it will be only a partial description, not really describing it in its entirety.

Some might say that the web is about protocols. But how many people use the web THINKING about protocols? It's more about how the web is organized under the hood.  
Similarly, a car is a four-wheeled, self-driving vehicle. You can make a car with an combustion engine and an electric motor, but it will still be a car.

## The web is about people and connecting with them.

We write to people in messengers, explore other people's thoughts on blogs and streaming services, indirectly interact with people's products in services like banks and cloud services.  
And if in the case of services I understand robotization - so people need to do less work and it is easier for all of us to do our own things, in the case of communication, algorithms, likes and enforced formats seem harmful to me. I've already written about this in the [article](/thoughts/social_networks/).

As a friend of mine said: the best social network is the already existing internet network.  
This approach seems to be the essence of the \[[small](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/)/[indie](https://indieweb.org/)/[yester](https://yesterweb.org/)\]web.

## I'm in love with the way the small web feels.

-   take long walks through links
-   saving endless pages to look at later
-   to read people's explicit positions
-   to explore personalities and their aesthetics
-   strange designs
-   big websites about small topics

And it is these feelings that I want to share with the world.

<section class=card>
	So far, I haven't figured out exactly how I'm going to display a list of all the sites I've found. <br>
	This is a bit of a challenge, because I plan to have 200+ entities there. <br>
	Therefore, at the moment, I will save all links in a <a class="primary" href="websites/"> simple document</a>, and then use the links from it.
